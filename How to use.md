## 🤝 How to Use the Trade Calculator
This is the most powerful part of the app. It helps you see if a trade is "Win" or "Loss."

1.  **Turn it ON:** Click the **Trade** button in the app until it says **Trade (ON)**.
2.  **Add Pets:** Hover over a pet and press the **`X` key**.
    *   The app is smart! It automatically knows if the pet belongs to **You** or the **Other Person**.
    *   Pressing `X` adds the pet to the trade list.
    *   Pressing `Z` just shows the value without adding it.
3.  **Add Gems:** Type the total amount of Gems being offered in the **Entry Box** next to the trade list.
4.  **See the Result:** The app will calculate the total for both sides and show you who is winning the trade!

## ⚙️ Understanding Settings
Click on **Settings** to customize how the app works. Here is what each setting does:

*   **GUI Stealth Mode:** Hides the app windows for a split second when taking a screenshot so they don't get in the way.
*   **Show GUI Only in Roblox:** The app will automatically hide itself if you click away from Roblox to another window (like Chrome).
*   **Find Value Key:** Change the `Z` key to any other key you prefer for finding values.
*   **Update Trade Key:** Change the `X` key to any other key you prefer for adding pets to trades.
*   **Batch Size:** How many images the app looks at once. Keep this at 1 for most computers.
*   **Calculator Size:** Makes the calculator window bigger or smaller on your screen.

## 🧮 Using the Calculator
If you just need a quick math tool, click the **Calculator** button.
*   It works like a normal calculator, but you can use shortcuts:
    *   Type **`k`** for Thousands (1k = 1,000)
    *   Type **`m`** for Millions (1m = 1,000,000)
    *   Type **`b`** for Billions (1b = 1,000,000,000)

## 📈 Updating Pet Values (Database)
The game prices change all the time! You can update the app's brain (the database) with the latest prices:

1.  **Stay Updated:** Every time the Cosmic Values website updates, you need to update your app. We recommend clicking the **Value** button and running a scan **every day** before you start trading. A full scan typically only takes **1 to 5 minutes** to complete.
2.  **Select Categories:** You will see **8 options** (Titanics, Huges, Exclusives, etc.). Click the **Checkboxes** for the categories you want to update (or click "All").
3.  **Settings Explained:**
    *   **Max Pages to Scan:** This tells the app how deep to look into the website. Keeping this at `9999` ensures you get every single pet, but you can set it lower if you only want to scan the first few pages.
    *   **Simultaneous Windows:** This is like opening multiple tabs in Google Chrome at the same time. If you set this to `3`, the app will open 3 web pages at once to download data 3x faster!
4.  **Start Scan:** Click **Start Scan**. The app will visit the website and save everything into its **Database**.
5.  **Export:** It also saves a copy as an Excel file in the **Exports** folder so you can look at the full list of values whenever you want!
